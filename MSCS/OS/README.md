A class-room implementation of block-device based file system and file system checker (as cool as FSCK).
Modelled on top of FUSE (File system in User space), in Python. 
The coolest files are (obviously!) 
 - csefsck.py - File system checker
 - csefsck.repy (almost exactly same as previous one, except modified to implement within REPY constraints)
 - lind_fs_calls.py -  very working File system, please don't ask any "practical" questions!
